	 * On STM32F4 the timers are not running directly from pure APB1 or
	 * APB2 clock busses.  The APB1 and APB2 clocks used for timers might
	 * be the double of the APB1 and APB2 clocks.  This depends on the
	 * setting in DCKCFGR register. By default the behaviour is the
	 * following: If the Prescaler APBx is greater than 1 the derived timer
	 * APBx clocks will be double of the original APBx frequencies. Only if
	 * the APBx prescaler is set to 1 the derived timer APBx will equal the
	 * original APBx frequencies.
	 *
	 * In our case here the APB1 is devided by 4 system frequency and APB2
	 * divided by 2. This means APB1 timer will be 2 x APB1 and APB2 will
	 * be 2 x APB2. So when we try to calculate the prescaler value we have
	 * to use rcc_apb1_freqency * 2!!!
	 *
	 * For additional information see reference manual for the stm32f4
	 * familiy of chips. Page 204 and 213
